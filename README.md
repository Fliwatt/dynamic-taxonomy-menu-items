# Dynamic Taxonomy Menu Items for WordPress

This is still a work in progress.

This is a lightweight plugin to add a dynamic submenu of taxonomy items into a WordPress menu.  It is known to work with [Nav Menu Roles](https://www.kathyisawesome.com/nav-menu-roles/).
Caution is indicated if trying to use it with a menu plugin that makes significant changes to the default WordPress menu.
